KEY INSIGHTS (2025 Analysis)
-------------------------------

1. **Dominant Categories:** 
   - Over 80% of trade value is concentrated in steel-based HSN codes, aligning with known industry and international trends for utility steel products in the kitchenware sector.
2. **Macro Trends:**
   - Year-over-year imports and duty paid showed steady growth, peaking in 2023, followed by notable volatility in 2024–25—likely reflecting supply chain shocks or regulatory changes.
3. **Pareto/Category Impact:**
   - Just 2-3 HSN categories drive most value (clear “80/20” pattern). Miscellaneous “Other” HSNs hold sizeable volume, suggesting possible opportunities for further categorization or market focus.
4. **Unit Economics:**
   - Landed cost per capacity/specification is strongly clustered at lower price points; select products (large or premium items) show outlier costs due to shipment, tariff, or supply factors.
5. **Data Automation Advantage:**
   - This project’s data pipeline saves significant manual effort and increases analytic depth compared to traditional Excel methods. The workflow is reusable and robust for future quarterly/yearly trade cycles.

LIMITATIONS
-------------------------------

- **Supplier Logic Not Performed:**  
   - Supplier name and address fields were not available/usable in provided sample. Supplier longevity and status by year could not be mapped; note for future dataset enrichment.
- **NLP/Parsing Limitations:**  
   - While model, capacity, and material are extracted from “Goods Description,” product diversity and non-standard formatting mean some edge cases may remain uncategorized.
- **No Real-Time Update:**  
   - The current workflow is for batch (“static”) analysis. For streaming or live analytics, further pipeline enhancements and source system integration would be required.

-------------------------------
INDUSTRY CONTEXT (2025 Market Facts)
-------------------------------

- India’s value-added kitchenware import market is expanding, but faces headwinds from global tariff realignments and post-pandemic logistics challenges.
- Steel has retained leadership in utility and institutional consumption, with premiumization and traceability (“green steel”) as modern trade drivers.
- Digital, automated data analysis—as completed in this project—is now a best practice for trade strategy and regulatory compliance.
